1. No interactions with Rank NFT's -> BRONZE/SILVER/GOLD
2. Threads/Topics opening not implemented.
3. All informations can be fetch from smart contract by "get" functions.
 - > getUsername(address _addr)  // returns username of the wallet address .


- [x] User struct is designed to includes all informations.

- [x] - ALL USERS MUST PAY 0,0666 usdc + gas to POST AN ENTRY.

    - Issues :
        - How can I get "RANK" NFT's in smart contract ? 
        - I created enum Ranks{BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD} but it is just integer right now. I need to
        - get NFT's of the users.
